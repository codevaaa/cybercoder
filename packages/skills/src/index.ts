 * A "skill" is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that becomes the system
 * prompt of an isolated sub-agent. Sub-agents run their own agent loop with a
 * restricted toolset and return their final assistant text as a summary to the
 * caller (which is typically the main agent loop via the spawn_subagent tool).
